## This is a new heading

### This is a smaller heading

### **This is a BOLDED heading**

#### *This is an italicized heading*

##### Remember you can use the compass tool to switch to visual markdown editor, which is helpful if you forgot how to format things in code

Superscript example: (2 - 5)^3^

###### *Format superscript using ^ 3 ^ but with no spaces* 

Subscript example: 25~ab~

###### *Format subscript using ~ ab ~ but with no spaces*

### This time I am going to insert a picture
#### *Insert a picture using this syntax: ! [ alt text here ] ( path-to-image-here ). For the path to image, you just need to make sure you saved the picture you want to use to the right R folder that you have setup on your computer*

## Time to add a code chunk
```{r}

W <- function(a, b, L) {
  
  a * (L ^ b)
}

# W is is the expected fish weight in g
# a and b are species-dependent parameter values 
# L is total fish length in cm

```

#### Find mass (g) for the Milkfish, Giant Trevally, and the Great Barracuda
```{r}

milkfish <- W(a = 0.0905, b = 2.52, L = 60)

giant_treve <- W(a = 0.0353, b = 3.05, L = 60)

barr <- W(a = 0.0181, b = 3.27, L = 60)

```

#### Mark and store fish length using sequence function
```{r}

fish_length <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, by = 1)

```

#### Estimate weight for giant barracudas along the range
```{r}

barracuda_weight <- W(a = 0.0181,
                     b = 3.27,
                     L = fish_length)

# This style of coding is called vertical coding, and is best for readability

```

#### Bind the weights and estimated barracuda lengths into a single data frame
```{r}

barracuda_df <- data.frame(fish_length, barracuda_weight)

# fish length and barracuda weight will be columns in the data frame

```

#### Create a ggplot of length vs weight for the Giant Barracuda
```{r}

ggplot(data = barracuda_df, aes(x = fish_length, y = barracuda_weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs (x = "Barracuda Length (cm)",
        y = "Barracuda Weight (g)",
        title = "Giant Barracuda Sizes in Hawaiian Estuaries")

```
